                     Basic Functional Programming
 *)
(* Objective:

   This lab is intended to get you up and running with the course's
   assignment submission system, and thinking about core concepts
   introduced in class, including:

    * concrete versus abstract syntax
    * atomic types
    * first-order functional programming
*)

  Part 0: Testing your Gradescope Interaction

  Labs and problem sets in CS51 are submitted using the Gradescope
  system. By now, you should be set up with Gradescope.

  ........................................................................
  Exercise 1: To make sure that the setup works, submit this file,
  just as is, under the filename "lab1.ml", to the Lab 1 assignment on
  the CS51 Gradescope web site.
  ........................................................................

  When you submit labs (including this one) Gradescope will check that
  the submission compiles cleanly, and if so, will run a set of unit
  tests on the submission. For this part 0 submission, the submission
  should compile cleanly, but most of the unit tests will fail (as you
  haven't done the exercises yet). But that's okay. We won't be checking
  the correctness of your labs until the "virtual quiz" this
  weekend. See the syllabus for more information about virtual quizzes,
  our very low stakes method for grading labs.

  Now let's get back to doing the remaining exercises so that more of
  the unit tests pass.

     *******************************************************************
     We use the commenting convention in our code throughout the
     course that code snippets within comments are demarcated with
     backquotes, for instance, `x + 3` or `fun x -> x`. You can think
     of this as corresponding to the fixed-width font in the textbook.
     *******************************************************************

  ........................................................................
  Exercise 2: So that you can see how the unit tests in labs work,
  replace the `failwith` expression below with the integer `42`, so that
  `exercise2` is a function that returns `42` (instead of failing). When
  you submit, the Exercise 2 unit test should then pass.
  ......................................................................*)

let exercise2 () = 42 ;;

(* From here on, you'll want to test your lab solutions locally before
   submitting them at the end of lab to Gradescope. A simple way to do that
   is to cut and paste the exercises into an OCaml interpreter, such as
   utop, which you run with the command

    % utop

   You can also use the more basic version, ocaml:

    % ocaml

   We call this kind of interaction a "read-eval-print loop" or
   "REPL". Alternatively, you can feed the whole file to OCaml with the
   command:

    % ocaml < lab1.ml

   to see what happens. We'll introduce other methods soon. *)

(*======================================================================
  Part 1: Concrete versus abstract syntax

  We've distinguished concrete from abstract syntax. Abstract syntax
  corresponds to the substantive tree structuring of expressions;
  concrete syntax corresponds to the particulars of how those structures
  are made manifest in the language's textual notation.

  In the presence of multiple operators, issues of precedence and
  associativity become important in constructing the abstract syntax
  from the concrete syntax.

  ........................................................................
  Exercise 3: Consider the following abstract syntax tree:

     ~-
      |
      |
      -
      ^
     / \
    /   \
   5     3

  that is, the negation of the result of subtracting 3 from 5.  To
  emphasize that the two operators are distinct, we've used the concrete
  symbol `~-` (a tilde followed by a hyphen character, an alternative
  spelling of the negation operation; see the Stdlib module) to notate
  the negation.

  How might this *abstract* syntax be expressed in the *concrete* syntax
  of OCaml using the fewest parentheses? Replace the `failwith`
  expression with the appropriate OCaml expression to assign the value
  to the variable `exercise3` below.
  ......................................................................*)

let exercise3 () : int = ~-(5-3) ;;

(* Hint: The OCaml concrete expression `~- 5 - 3` does *not*
   correspond to the abstract syntax above.

   ........................................................................
   Exercise 4: Draw the tree that the concrete syntax `~- 5 - 3` does
   correspond to. Check it with a member of the course staff.
   ......................................................................*)
(* 
      -
    /  \
   /    \
  ~-     3
  |
  |
  5 
  *)


(*......................................................................
  Exercise 5: Associativity plays a role in cases when two operators
  used in the concrete syntax have the same precedence. For instance,
  the concrete expression `2 + 1 + 0` might have abstract syntax as
  reflected in the following two parenthesizations:

    2 + (1 + 0)

  or

    (2 + 1) + 0

  As it turns out, both of these parenthesizations evaluate to the same
  result (`3`). (That's because addition is an associative operation.)

  Construct an expression that uses an arithmetic operator twice, but
  evaluates to two different results dependent on the associativity of
  the operator. Use this expression to determine the associativity of
  the operator. Check your answer with a member of the course staff if
  you'd like.
  ......................................................................*)

(*======================================================================
  Part 2: Types and type inference

  ........................................................................
  Exercise 6: What are appropriate types to replace the ??? in the
  expressions below? Test your solution by uncommenting the examples
  (removing the `(*` and `*)` at start and end) and verifying that no
  typing error is generated.
  ......................................................................*)



let exercise6a : int = 42 ;;

let exercise6b : string =
  let greet y = "Hello " ^ y
  in greet "World!";;

let exercise6c : float -> float =
  fun x -> x +. 11.1 ;;

let exercise6d : int -> bool =
  fun x -> x < x + 1 ;;

let exercise6e : int -> float -> int =
  fun x -> fun y -> x + int_of_float y ;;



(*======================================================================
  Part 3: First-order functional programming

  For warmup, here are some "finger exercises" defining simple functions
  before moving onto more complex problems.

  ........................................................................
  Exercise 7: Define a function `square` that squares its
  argument. We've provided a bit of template code, supplying the first
  line of the function definition but the body of the skeleton code just
  causes a failure by forcing an error using the built-in `failwith`
  function. Edit the code to implement `square` properly.

  Test out your implementation of `square` by modifying the template
  code below to define `exercise7` to be the `square` function applied
  to the integer 5. You'll want to replace the `0` with the correct
  function call.

  Thorough testing is important in all your work, and we hope to impart
  this view to you in CS51. Testing will help you find bugs, avoid
  mistakes, and teach you the value of short, clear, testable
  functions. In the file `lab1_tests.ml`, weâ€™ve put some prewritten
  tests for `square` using the testing method of Section 6.5 in the
  book. Spend some time understanding how the testing function works and
  why these tests are comprehensive. Then test your code by compiling
  and running the test suite:

    % ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind lab1_tests.byte
    % ./lab1_tests.byte

  You should add some tests for other functions in the lab to get some
  practice with automated unit testing.
  ......................................................................*)

let square (x : int) : int  = x*x;;

let exercise7 = square 5;;

(*......................................................................
  Exercise 8: Define a function `exclaim`,that, given a string,
  "exclaims" it by capitalizing it and suffixing an exclamation mark.
  The `String.capitalize_ascii` function may be helpful here. For
  example, you should get the following behavior:

   # exclaim "hello" ;;
   - : string = "Hello!"
   # exclaim "Ciao" ;;
   - : string = "Ciao!"
   # exclaim "what's up" ;;
   - : string = "What's up!"
  ......................................................................*)

let exclaim (text : string) : string =
  String.capitalize_ascii(text);;

(*......................................................................
  Exercise 9: Define a function `needs_small_bills` that determines, given a
  price, if one will need a bill smaller than a 20 to pay for the
  item. For instance, a price of 100 can be paid for with 20s (and
  larger denominations) alone, but a price of 105 will require a bill
  smaller than a 20 (for the 5 left over after the 100 is paid). We will
  assume (perhaps unrealistically) that all prices are given as integers
  and (more realistically) that 50s, 100s, and larger denomination bills
  are not available, only 1s, 5s, 10s, and 20s. In addition, you may
  assume all prices given are non-negative.

   # needs_small_bills 105 ;;
   - : bool = true
   # needs_small_bills 100 ;;
   - : bool = false
   # needs_small_bills 150 ;;
   - : bool = true
  ......................................................................*)

let needs_small_bills (price : int) : bool =
  price mod 20 <> 0 ;;

(*......................................................................
  Exercise 10:

  The calculation of the date of Easter, a calculation so important to
  early Christianity that it was referred to simply by the Latin
  "computus" ("the computation"), has been the subject of innumerable
  algorithms since the early history of the Christian church.

  The algorithm to calculate the computus function is given in Problem
  31 in the textbook, which you'll want to refer to.

  Write two functions that, given a year, calculate the month
  (`computus_month`) and day (`computus_day`) of Easter in that year via
  the Computus function.

  In 2018, Easter took place on April 1st. Your functions should reflect
  that:

   # computus_month 2018;;
   - : int = 4
   # computus_day 2018 ;;
   - : int = 1
  ......................................................................*)

let computus_month (year : int) : int =
  let a = year mod 19 in
  let b = year / 100 in
  let c = year mod 100 in
  let d = b / 4 in
  let e = b mod 4 in
  let f = (b + 8) / 25 in
  let g = (b - f + 1) / 3 in
  let h = (19 * a + b - d - g + 15) mod 30 in
  let i = c / 4 in
  let k = c mod 4 in
  let l = (32 + 2 * e + 2 * i - h - k) mod 7 in
  let m = (a + 11 * h + 22 * l) / 451 in
  let month = (h + l - 7 * m + 114) / 31 in
  month
;;

let computus_day (year : int) : int =
  let a = year mod 19 in
  let b = year / 100 in
  let c = year mod 100 in
  let d = b / 4 in
  let e = b mod 4 in
  let f = (b + 8) / 25 in
  let g = (b - f + 1) / 3 in
  let h = (19 * a + b - d - g + 15) mod 30 in
  let i = c / 4 in
  let k = c mod 4 in
  let l = (32 + 2 * e + 2 * i - h - k) mod 7 in
  let m = (a + 11 * h + 22 * l) / 451 in
  let day = ((h + l - 7 * m + 114) mod 31) + 1 in
  day

  Part 4: Code review

  A frustrum (see Figure 6.3 in the textbook) is a three-dimensional
  solid formed by slicing off the top of a cone parallel to its
  base. The formula for the volume of a frustrum in terms of its radii
  and height is given in the textbook as well.

  As an experienced programmer at Frustromco, Inc., you've been assigned
  to mentor a beginning programmer. Your mentee has been given the task
  of implementing a function `frustrum_volume` to calculate the volume
  of a frustrum. Here is your mentee's stab at this task:

  (* frustrum_volume -- calculate the frustrum *)
  let frustrum_volume a b c =
  let a =
  let s a = a * a in
  let h = b in 3.1416
  *. h /. float_of_int 3*. (a *.
  a +. c  *.  c+.a *. c) in a
  ;;

  As this neophyte programmer's mentor, you're asked to perform a code
  review on this code. You test the code out on an example -- a frustrum
  with radii 3 and 4 and height 4 -- and you get

   # frustrum_volume 3. 4. 4. ;;
   - : float = 154.985599999999977

  which is (more or less) the right answer. Nonetheless, you have a
  strong sense that the code can be considerably improved. *)

(*......................................................................
  Exercise 11: Go over the code with your lab partner, making whatever
  modifications you think can improve the code, placing your revised
  version just below. Once you've converged on a version of the code
  that you think is best, call over a staff member and go over your
  revised code together.
  ......................................................................*)

(*** Place your revised version here within this comment.
 ***)

(* During the code review, your boss drops by and looks over your
   proposed code. Your boss thinks that the function should be compatible
   with the header line given at <https://url.cs51.io/frustrum>. You
   agree.

   ........................................................................
   Exercise 12: Revise your code (if necessary) to make sure that it uses
   the header line given at <https://url.cs51.io/frustrum>.
   ......................................................................*)

(*** Place your updated revised version below, *not* as a comment,
     because we'll be unit testing it. (The two lines we provide are
     just to allow the unit tests to have something to compile
     against. You'll want to just delete them and start over.) ***)

let  frustrum_volume (radius1 : float) (radius2 : float) (height : float) = 
  Float.pi *. height *.(radius1*.radius1 +. radius1 *. radius2 +. radius2 *. radius2)/.3.0

  Part 5: Utilizing recursion

  ........................................................................
  Exercise 13: The factorial function takes the product of an integer
  and all the integers below it. It is generally notated as !. For
  example, 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. Write a function `factorial` that
  calculates the factorial of its integer argument. Note: the factorial
  function is generally only defined on non-negative integers (0, 1, 2,
  3, ...). For the purpose of this exercise, you may assume all inputs
  will be non-negative.

  For example,

   # factorial 4 ;;
   - : int = 24
   # factorial 0 ;;
   - : int = 1
  ......................................................................*)

let rec factorial (x : int) : int =
  if x=0 then 1 else  x * factorial (x-1);;

(*......................................................................
  Exercise 14: Define a recursive function `sum_from_zero` that sums all
  the integers between 0 and its argument, inclusive.

   # sum_from_zero 5 ;;
   - : int = 15
   # sum_from_zero 100 ;;
   - : int = 5050
   # sum_from_zero ~-3 ;;
   - : int = -6

  (The sum from 0 to 100 was famously if apocryphally performed by
  the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss as a seven-year-old, *in his
  head*!)
  ......................................................................*)

let rec sum_from_zero (x : int) : int =
  if x=0 then 0 else sum_from_zero (x-1);;
